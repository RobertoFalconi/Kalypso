	  <h2>What is Kalypso?</h2>
	  <center>Kalypso is a dynamic web app that allows you to encrypt messages. It uses Kerckhoffs principle: A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.</center>
		<h2>How does it work?</h2>
	  <center>We encrypt your messages without saving nothing on our servers. We do not even save the encrypted message!</center>
