Feature: QR Code generation
As an unregistered user
I want to use the cryptography algorithm
So that I can generate a QR Code with the encrypted message

Scenario:
When I go to encryption page
And I type something
And I click Encrypt
Then I should be able to generate a QR Code with the encrypted message
